CHANGES to TextIndexNG3 3.1.14 for minaraad
-------------------------------------------

The minaraad website uses TextIndexNG3 3.1.14 but with a few changes.
Grab a tarball here:
http://tgz.zestsoftware.nl/TextIndexNG3-3.1.14-minaraad.tgz

To recreate that one, do the following:

- Download the original tarball:
  http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/textindexng/TextIndexNG3-3.1.14.tar.gz

- Copy the ``TextIndexNG3`` directory to your ``Products``
    directory.

- Make sure that the INSTANCE_HOME environment variable has been set
  (or figure out the correct directories yourself).  I usually look at
  the bin/runzope script.

- Remove the comments in
  ``$INSTANCE_HOME/Products/TextIndexNG3/adapters/configure.zcml``.
  except the one with ExtensibleIndexableObjectWrapper, *that must
  stay in comment*.
  XXX THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, PLEASE DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP. XXX

- Replace ``Extensions/Install.py`` with the file
  ``http://textindexng.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/textindexng/TextIndexNG3/trunk/Extensions/Install.py?revision=1682``
  This is necessary for the Quickinstaller Uninstall and Reinstall to work
  on Plone 2.5. (If you miss to do this, the reinstall will not work, which
  is not such a big problem after all.)
  At the time of this writing we use TXNG 3.1.13, this requirement may
  become obsolate at a later release that includes this patch.

  XXXX This is currently broken, so the reinstall will fail, but it
  does not matter.

- FIX THE PERMISSIONS of the files. TextIndexNG often ships with the
  wrong permissions. Basically all files must be readable (r) and all
  directories must be executable (rx) for the process that runs
  zope. Practically this means:

         % cd Products/TextIndexNG3
         % chmod -R a+r *
         % chmod a+x `find -type d`

  or something similar adapted for your situation.
