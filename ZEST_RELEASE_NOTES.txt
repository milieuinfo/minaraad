Release notes from Zest
=======================

Manual fixes to do on the site.

For general notes on using this buildout, see the file README.txt.


Upgrade to 6.1 (October 2016)
-----------------------------

For local development use, Maurits has added live data on the Office
drive, with a copy of the blobstorage, and a Data.fs migrated from the
postgres relstorage data.  See RELSTORAGE.txt for hints, otherwise ask
him to help you set this up locally.

- We update to Plone 4.3.11, so run the Plone upgrade.

- Run any upgrade steps in the Extra Products control panel.

- PloneFormGen has its own captcha based on recaptcha.net.  We have
  updated the code to version 2 of the api, so please check that you
  can add a captcha field to a PloneFormGen form and that you can use
  it, without getting problems about keys.  Locally you may see errors
  that localhost is not an allowed domain for the given key.  You can
  go to recaptcha.net (taken over by Google) to setup a pair of
  development keys.  Or use the pair made by Maurits for local use
  only:

    localhost site key:   6LdZgwcUAAAAAI00BxouvuYoIbjkztfhc8XvQYQS
    localhost secret key: 6LdZgwcUAAAAAFSd_Tl28ZxZ5uIlVQFnGkUsT9lh

  You need to set those in the PloneFormGen control panel on the
  Captcha tab.

  This may need to be done for the actual live codes too.  Someone may
  need to login with the minaraad account on recaptcha.net and update
  the account to be valid for some more sites:

  - www.minaraad.be
  - oefen.minaraad.be
  - ontwikkel.minaraad.be

  Otherwise after you add a captcha field on a PloneFormGen form, you
  see an error instead of the captcha:

    FOUT voor site-eigenaar:
    Invalid domain for site key


Upgrade to 6.0.0 (2016-02-24)
