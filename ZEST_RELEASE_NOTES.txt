Release notes from Zest
=======================

Manual fixes to do on the site.

Upgrade to 3.30
---------------

- Run the portal_setup upgrade steps.  There are steps for
  Products.minaraad, minaraad.projects and collective.emaillogin.

- The main_template has temporarily been customized in
  portal_skins/custom.  Remove it there again.

- Use 'object/@@is_attending' as ETag expression for Events and
  Hearings; the special rule for these two can be merged with the
  standard Content rule again, as this expression is safe for all types.


Upgrade to 3.28 [DONE]
----------------------

- Remove the getStartdate index completely from the catalog.


Upgrade to 3.19 [DONE]
----------------------

- Remove the get_end_time and getStart_time FieldIndexes and replace
  them with DateIndexes!  And reindex them.


Upgrade to using projects.minaraad [DONE]
-----------------------------------------

There are some indexes and metadata columns in the live site of which
there is no evidence that they are actually needed.  So we may as well
remove them.  Let's do that manually:

- Go to the portal_catalog.

- On the Indexes tab remove the getEmail index.

- On the Metadata tab remove:
  - getCategory
  - getEmail
  - getItemstartdate
  - getStartdate

- base2-dom-fp.js has been turned of in portal_javascripts for a FireFox 4
  incompatibility. This can be turned on again because a patched version in
  included in the browser overrides in Products.minaraad.

Now the interesting stuff for the digibib.

- reinstall Products.minaraad

- install jquery.pyproxy, projects.minaraad and anything else that has
  not been installed yet or that needs updating.

- run the upgrade steps of Products.minaraad

- Rename Digibib to 'Digibib Oud' (id digibib-1)

- Add a new Digibib with title Digibib and id digibib in the root of
  the site.

- In the workflow dropdrop of the new Digibib choose a new workflow
  policy 'Digibib Policy' for this folder (not needed for sub
  folders).

- In the Digibib create:

  - an Organisation container with id organisaties and title
    Samenwerkingen

  - a Meeting container with id meetings and title Vergaderingen

  - a Project container with id projects and title Projecten

- run the upgrade steps of minaraad.projects.  You can opt to do the
  'Migrate advisories to projects' step separately, as that takes a
  long time.  This migates/copies Advisories from the years 2009
  through 2011 to Projects: (alternatively, go to
  @@migrate_advisories_to_projects in the Plone Site root).  Note that
  you may get an error during a reindex of a Word document, but that
  can apparently be ignored:

    /opt/local/bin/wvHtml: line 146:  2464 Segmentation fault
    "$wv_exec" $wv_opts -x "$xmlcfg" -d "$t_dir" -b "$name" "$i_file" > "$t_dir"/"$o_file"

- Go to the folder 'contactpersonen' in the root of the site and set
  the display to 'Contactpersonen overzicht' (list_contact_persons).

- Add a few groups, at least 'Dagelijks Bestuur' with ignace as member
  (search for decancq).  Give this groups the global DigiBibViewer role.

- In the Site Setup go to Projectinstellingen and configure this.
