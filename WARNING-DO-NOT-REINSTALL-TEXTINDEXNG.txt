Note from Maurits.
------------------

Currently (7 March 2008) TextIndexNG3 is listed in the quick installer
as installed.  But it does not have an installed version number.  So
version 3.1.14 is listed as a newer version and wants to be
reinstalled.

But if you reinstall (or uninstall) it, it throws away the existing
TextIndexNG3 indexes (like Title) and then complains that they do not
exist.  Via the undo button you can bring them back.

This looks a bit dangerous to me.  But I have not yet managed to find
a good series of steps to take to repair this.  Searching works
though, so for now we need not worry.
