# Admin username and password to connect to the Zope server:
USER = 'youradminusername'
PASS = 'yourpassword'

# Server name.  This is a new setting that was introduced because
# the url is used in the e-mails that are sent as well, so on the
# live site it should NOT be localhost.
SERVER = 'localhost'

# When SERVER is not localhost or 127.0.0.1, we check the
# following settings as well, otherwise they are ignored; you
# should still keep them in the file, just to be on the safe side.
# An empty string is fine then.

# Port that Zope runs on:
PORT = '8080'
# id of the Plone Site:
PLONESITE = 'minaraad'
