Errors
======

WARNING OFS.Uninstalled Could not import class 'CSCachingPolicyManager'
from module 'Products.CacheSetup.content.caching_policy_manager'

 - Tried to install `Products.CacheSetup` but got me other errors.
 - Tried to run `Products.CacheSetup` uninstall handler.
   That didn't resolve the issue.
 - Tried to delete `caching_policy_manager` from ZMI.

Status: open. I'll leave it. It doesn't seem to harm.
