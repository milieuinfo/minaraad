Minaraad

    This is the Plone Product for Minaraad. To install this product make sure   
    all dependencies are installed first and then install it using the quick  
    installer.

For the environment on the server:

1) Install Python 2.4.3 from
   http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4.3/Python-2.4.3.tgz
   And read the Installer manual

2) Install Zope 2.9.5 from
    http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.9.2/Zope-2.9.5.tgz
    And read the Installer manual

3) Install PIL 1.1.5 from
   http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.5.tar.gz
   And read the Installer manual

4) Install a Zope instance via
   /YOUR/ZOPEINSTALLATION/DIR/bin/mkzopeinstance.py



Once the environment on the server is created you can add minaraad product and all its dependencies:

1) In the Zope instance directory, add minaraad and all its dependencies
   to Products/

    Dependencies:

        * Plone 2.5.2-1
		(http://plone.googlecode.com/files/Plone-2.5.2-1.tar.gz)
        XXX this dependency has changed recently

        * FCKeditor 2.2
        (http://ovh.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/fckeditor/FCKeditor.Plone2.2.zip)

        XXX upgrade occasionally? this is an old version

        * RichDocument svn trunk
        (https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/RichDocument/branches/2.0)
        XXX this dependency has changed its branch recently
        
        * SimpleAttachment svn trunk
        (https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/SimpleAttachment/branches/1.0)
        XXX this is a new dependency
    
        * OrderableReferenceField
        (https://svn.plone.org/svn/archetypes/MoreFieldsAndWidgets/OrderableReferenceField/trunk)
    
        * PloneTranslations from trunk:
        (https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PloneTranslations/trunk)
        This should overwrite the PloneTranslations from Plone.
    
        * PlonePAS from this branch:
        https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PlonePAS/branches/ree-2.1-migration-fixed
        This should overwrite the PlonePAS from Plone.
        This is version 2.1 but the migration part is fixed by
        backporting necessary changes from the trunk.

        * intellitext from this branch:
        https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/intelligenttext/trunk

        * TextIndexNG3 from
        (http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/textindexng/TextIndexNG3-3.1.14.tar.gz)
    
        - Copy (!) the ``TextIndexNG3`` directory to your ``Products``
            directory.
    
        - In ``$INSTANCE_HOME/Products/TextIndexNG3/extension_modules`` do ``python2.4
            setup.py install --home=$INSTANCE_HOME``.
    
        - Remove the comments in
            ``$INSTANCE_HOME/Products/TextIndexNG3/adapters/configure.zcml``.
            except the one with ExtensibleIndexableObjectWrapper, *that must stay in comment*.
            XXX THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, PLEASE DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP. XXX
    
        - Make sure that pdftotext is available.  Installing xpdf takes
            care of that.  On Debian/Ubuntu try ``apt-get install xpdf``.
            An install of just the poppler-utils or xpdf-utils package
            works as well.

        - Make sure that the wvWare utility is available.
            On Debian/Ubuntu try ``apt-get install wv``.
            XXX I am not sure this is needed, but I think this takes care
            XXX of indexing Word documents.

        - Replace ``Extensions/Install.py`` with the file
          ``http://textindexng.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/textindexng/TextIndexNG3/trunk/Extensions/Install.py?revision=1682``
          This is necessary for the Quickinstaller Uninstall and Reinstall to work
          on Plone 2.5. (If you miss to do this, the reinstall will not work, which
          is not such a big problem after all.)
          At the time of this writing we use TXNG 3.1.13, this requirement may
          become obsolate at a later release that includes this patch.

          XXXX This is currently broken, so the reinstall will fail, but it does not matter.

        - FIX THE PERMISSIONS of the files. TextIndexNG often ships with the wrong permissions. Basically
          all files must be readable (r) and all directories must be executable (rx) for the
          process that runs zope. Practically this means:

                 % cd Products/TextIndexNG3
                 % chmod -R a+r *
                 % chmod a+x `find -type d`

          or something similar adapted for your situation.

        * For running the test, make sure that PloneTestCase is installed.

        * Install 'lynx' (http://lynx.isc.org/)


2) - Copy i18n directory from product minaraad to the Zope instance directory.
   - remove all the .po and .pot files from YourZopeInstance/i18n EXCEPT plone-minaraad-nl.po

3) Translate the manager role (beheerder) to site admin and reviewer role (Redacteur) to  manager:
   - Go to YourZopeInstance/Products/PloneTranslations/i18n directory
   - open plone-nl.po
   - Go to:
       msgid "Manager"
       msgstr "Beheerder"
   - And change "Beheerder" to "Site admin"
   - Go to:
        msgid "Reviewer"
        msgstr "Redacteur"
   - And change "Redacteur" to "Manager"
