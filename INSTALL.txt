Minaraad

    This is the Plone Product for Minaraad. To install this product make sure
    all dependencies are installed first and then install it using the quick
    installer.

For the environment on the server:

1) Install Python 2.4.3 (or later) from
   http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4.3/Python-2.4.3.tgz
   And read the Installer manual

2) Install Zope 2.9.7 from
   http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.9.7/Zope-2.9.7-final.tgz
   And read the Installer manual

3) Install PIL 1.1.5 from
   http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.5.tar.gz
   And read the Installer manual

4) Install a Zope instance via
   /YOUR/ZOPEINSTALLATION/DIR/bin/mkzopeinstance.py



Once the environment on the server is created you can add minaraad
product and all its dependencies:

1) In the Zope instance directory, add minaraad and all its dependencies
   to the Products/ dir.  Dependencies are:

   * Plone 2.5.2-1
     http://plone.googlecode.com/files/Plone-2.5.2-1.tar.gz

   * FCKeditor 2.2
     http://ovh.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/fckeditor/FCKeditor.Plone2.2.zip

   * RichDocument 2.0
     http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/RichDocument/tags/2.0

   * SimpleAttachment 1.0 svn branch, (revision 39079 - nothing
     has changed since then and there is no proper tag for that revision)
     http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/SimpleAttachment/branches/1.0

   * OrderableReferenceField
     http://svn.plone.org/svn/archetypes/MoreFieldsAndWidgets/OrderableReferenceField/tags/1.1

   * PloneTranslations:
     http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PloneTranslations/tags/3.0.0
     This should overwrite the PloneTranslations from Plone.

   * PlonePAS from this branch:
     http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PlonePAS/branches/ree-2.1-migration-fixed
     This should overwrite the PlonePAS from Plone.
     This is version 2.1 but the migration part is fixed by
     backporting necessary changes from the trunk.

   * intelligenttext
     http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/intelligenttext/tags/1.0.1

   * TextIndexNG3 3.1.14 but with a few changes:
     http://tgz.zestsoftware.nl/TextIndexNG3-3.1.14-minaraad.tgz

     For more info see TXNG.txt in the same directory as this INSTALL.txt/
     Install the extension modules as well (see system dependencies below).

   * For running the tests, make sure that PloneTestCase is installed.


2) Make the minaraad specific plone domain translations available.
   Specifically date_format_long/short and the Manager or Reviewer
   role.  Just do this:

   * Copy the i18n/plone-minaraad-nl.po file from the minaraad product
     to the Zope instance directory.  (Or add a symbolic link.)


3) Install system dependencies:

   * Install the extension modules from TextIndexNG3.  In
     ``$INSTANCE_HOME/Products/TextIndexNG3/extension_modules`` do:
     ``python2.4 setup.py install --home=$INSTANCE_HOME``.

   * Make sure that pdftotext is available to be able to index
     pdf files.  Installing xpdf takes care of that.  On
     Debian/Ubuntu try ``apt-get install xpdf``.  An install of
     just the poppler-utils or xpdf-utils package works as well.

   * Make sure that the wvWare utility is available to be able to
     word files.  On Debian/Ubuntu try ``apt-get install wv``.

   * Install 'lynx' (http://lynx.isc.org/)
