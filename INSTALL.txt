To use this as a basis for your project, do a

svn copy https://svn.zestsoftware.nl/svn/skeleton/trunk \
         https://svn.zestsoftware.nl/svn/yourproject

(after mkdir-ing your project dir in svn, of course).

Then there are some 'xxx_name_this' that need renaming:

* PROJECT at the top of 'main.aap'

* outfile at the top of model/generate.conf (change the author and
  email while you're at it, if applicable).

* svn mv model/xxx_name_this.zuml model/yourproject.zuml

Comment: please keep those names in lowercase. That seems to be the
emerging standard in newer projects (including zope 3).

Inside the UML model there are also a few things.

* Change the joinin into something for your project.

* Change (or remove) the tagged value workflow on that class.

* Rename or remove the workflow.

* Rename the project as a whole.
