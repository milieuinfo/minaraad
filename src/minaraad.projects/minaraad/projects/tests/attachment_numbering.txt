Attachment numbering
====================

Attachments in meetings are automagically numbered on display. This
test suite will ensure this works as expected.

We first need a 'DigiBib' object to store our Meetings:

    >>> self.setRoles(('Manager'))
    >>> self.add_digibib()
    >>> digibib = self.portal.digibib

We also need a browser as this test will mock user actions:

   >>> from Products.Five.testbrowser import Browser
   >>> browser = Browser()
